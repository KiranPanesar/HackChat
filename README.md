HackChat for iOS
========

This is the native iOS client for a non-persistant instant messaging platform we created for the Great Uni Hackathon at Cardiff University. You simply enter your username and join one of the rooms. You can then chat with other members in the same room.

The iOS app uses a few open source components:
* [socket.io-objc](https://github.com/pkyeck/socket.IO-objc) for implementing socketIO.
* [FlatUIKit](https://github.com/Grouper/FlatUIKit) to make things pretty.
* [RESideMenu](https://github.com/romaonthego/RESideMenu) for some extra shine.

The web app was built using NodeJS, AngularJS and implements socketIO for the messaging. and can be found [here](https://github.com/viperfx/hackchat).

Also, we won the hackathon, which is always a bonus!
